Yes Pranay, you're spot on again — **that “another flavor” refers to a *shared primary key* one-to-one relationship**, which **can be used in both unidirectional and bidirectional setups**, but really shines in **bidirectional** usage.

Let’s break it down in layers and then build it:

---

## 🧠 What Is Shared Primary Key One-to-One?

It’s when **two entities share the same primary key value**, and one entity’s ID **also acts as a foreign key** to the other.

So:
- Table A has PK `id`
- Table B has the same `id`, and that’s also a FK to A
- This makes the bond **super tight and unique**

---

## 📌 Why Use This?

- It’s perfect when you have a **dependent entity** that **cannot exist without the parent**, and they’re in a true 1:1 ownership — like `User` and `UserProfile`, or `Order` and `Invoice`.
- It keeps data **consistent and normalized**, with no redundant foreign key columns.
- Bonus: **indexing is faster**, and there’s **no need to join on different keys**.

---

## 📐 Schema-Level View

**Tables:**

```
users
-----
id (PK)

passports
----------
id (PK + FK to users.id)
```

So both `users.id` and `passports.id` refer to the **same value** and tie the rows directly.

---

## ✅ How to Do This in Code (Bidirectional Example)

### `User.java`
```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private Passport passport;
}
```

### `Passport.java`
```java
@Entity
public class Passport {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String passportNumber;

    @OneToOne
    @MapsId // 👈 KEY POINT: Tells Hibernate to use the same id as the User
    @JoinColumn(name = "id") // 👈 Optional, but explicit
    private User user;
}
```

> `@MapsId` means:
> > "Use the ID from the associated User as my own ID."

Hibernate will ensure:
- When you persist the `User`, the `Passport` shares the same ID.
- The DB enforces **1:1 mapping** through PK/FK.

## 💡 When to Use Shared Primary Key One-to-One

| Use Case | Ideal? |
|----------|--------|
| Tightly coupled entities | ✅ Absolutely |
| Child cannot exist without parent | ✅ Perfect |
| Minimal foreign key clutter | ✅ Yes |
| Slightly more complex setup | ⚠️ True |
| Needing flexibility to detach child | ❌ Not ideal (go for standard FK One-to-One)

---

## 👨‍🔧 Code Flow in Practice

```java
User user = new User();
user.setName("Pranay");

Passport passport = new Passport();
passport.setPassportNumber("ABC123");
passport.setUser(user); // Binds it

user.setPassport(passport);

userRepository.save(user); // saves both, with same id!
```

## 🔁 Comparison to Your Original Setup

| Feature | Your Setup (FK in User) | Shared PK Setup |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| FK column | `passport_id` in `users` | `id` in `passports`, FK to `users` |
| Cascade | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tight binding | ❌ (can be loosely associated) | ✅ (strong 1:1) |
| Easier to make bidirectional | ❌ (need extra config) | ✅ (natural with `@MapsId`) |
| Common for optional data | ✅ | ❌ not ideal if child is optional |

Would you like me to:
- Help you **refactor your current code to this shared PK setup**?
- Or show **test cases** that verify this tight coupling?
